SheetShaper is a tool created by Corey Kwiatkowski with the intentions to convert HTML and CSV files to excel with the main bread and butter of SheetShaper being the ability to grab any timestamps from a file organize them, parse dates with the shown parameters along with be able to combine them all into on nice organize excel documents. It also has data visualization with graphs and clicking on the graphs will give the specific data for that day!
